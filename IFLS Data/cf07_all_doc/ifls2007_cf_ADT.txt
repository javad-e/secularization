AC01               Acceptable grounds for a man to divorce

                   Variable AC01 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears

                   interviewee selected D and E, AC01 will have the value DE.  Use the key

BK05               Who is responsible for providing care

                   Variable BK05 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, BK05 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, BK05 will have the value DE.  Use the key

KD13               How do you know the traditional laws?

                   Variable KD13 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, KD13 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, KD13 will have the value DE.  Use the key

                   Variable PB4 can have multiple responses.  Users were asked to select 
                   all applicable responses from a list of all possible responses.  These were  
                   concatenated together into a single character string variable which appears  
                   in this public use file.  For example, if the interviewee selected responses 
                   A, C, and F from the list, PB4 will have the value ACF.  If the       
                   interviewee selected D and E, PB4 will have the value DE.  Use the key
